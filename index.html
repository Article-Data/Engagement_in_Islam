<h1 style="color:Gold; text-align:center; font-size:35px"> Engagement in Islam </h1> <br><br>




<p style="color:White; font-size: 30px; text-align:center;"> Engagement according to sharee'ah means that the man asks the woman to marry him.<br> 
The view of the scholars is that engagement is prescribed for one who wants to get married.</p> <br>


<p style="color:white; font-size: 20px; text-align:center;"> Allah says(Interpretation of the meaning): <br> </p>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 20px; text-align:center">
<i> "And there is no sin on you if you make a hint of bethrothal"</i><br>
Surah Al-Baqarah Verse 235

And it was narrated that the Prophet(Peace be upon him) got engaged to Aishah(r.a). (Al-Bukhaari, Al-Nikaah 4793).<br>
And also in Al-Saheeh it states that the Messenger(Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him) got engaged engaged to Hafsah(r.a). (Al-Bukhaari, Al-Nikaah 4830).
</p> <br>


<p style="color:White; font-size: 20px;"> 
The Messenger of Allah(Peace be upon him) encouraged the one wants to get engaged to look at the woman to whom he wishes to propose. According to the hadith,</p>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 20px; text-align:center">
"<i>When anyone of you proposes marriage to a woman, if he can look at that which will encourage him to go ahead and marry her, then let him do so.</i>" <br>
(Sunan Abu Dawood, Al-Nikaah, 2802; classed as hasan by Al-Albaani in Saheeh Abu Dawood 1832)

<p style="color:White; font-size: 20px;">
But in Islamic Sharee'ah, there are no specific practices that must be followed with regard to engagement. What some muslims do, announcing the engagement, having a party to celebrate and exchanging gifts, all comes under the heading of customs 
which are permissible in principle and none of them are haraam except those which sharee'ah indicates are haraam. These includes Exchanging of the rings between the couple. (A Custom which is known in Arabic as "Dublah". 
This custom goes against sharee'ah for following reasons: <br><br>

1. Some people think that these rings increase the love between the spouses and have an effect on their relationship. This is an ignorant(jaahil) belief and is an attachment to something for which there is no basis in sharee'ah 
and which does not make any sense. <br><br>

2. This Customs involves imitating the Non-Muslims. It is not a Muslim custom at all. The Prophet(peace be upon him) warned us against that when he said, "You will inevitably follow the paths of those who came before you, handspan by handspan, 
cubit by cubit, until even if they entered the hole of a lizard, you will follow them. <br><br>

3. This engagement usually takes place before the 'aqd(Marriage), in which case it is not permissible for the man to put the ring on his fiancee's hand himself, becuase she is still a stranger(Non-Mahram) to him, 
and has not yet become his Wife.
</p> <br><br><br><br>

<p style="color:White; font-size: 30px;">
Finally, we will quote the words of Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen (May Allah have mercy on him) on this matter:
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 20px; text-align:center;">
<i> " 'Dublah' is a word that refers to the engagement ring. In principle there is nothing wrong with rings(i.e. they are permissible), unless they are accompanied by certain beliefs such as 
When the man writes his name on the ring that he gives to his Fiance, and the woman writes her name on the ring and gives to her Fiance, believing that this will guarantee the bonds between the spouses. 
In this case this 'Dublah' or engagement ring is haraam, because it represents an attachment to something for which there is no basis in sharee'ah and whioh does not make sense.<br>
Simmilarly, it is not permissible for the man to put the ring on the Woman's hand himself, because she is not yet his Wife, so she is still a stranger to him.<br>
She is not his Wife until after the marriage contract is done.

And the Prophet(peace be upon him) said,<br> <i>"Whoever imitates people is one of them."</i><br>

<i>"And Allah has made for you from yourselves mates and has made for you from your mates; sons and grandchildren and has provided you from the good things.<br>
Then in falsehood do they believe and in the favor of Allah they disbelieve?"</i>
